## Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Development of Yen Language

The **Yen Language** project was developed with a combination of human effort and artificial intelligence (AI) assistance.

We value transparency, so we disclose that approximately:

- **40%** of the code was **generated or assisted by AI**, helping with:
  - Code structure suggestions
  - Drafting syntax trees (AST)
  - Writing helper functions (e.g., parsing, error handling)
  - Improving readability and performance
  - Translating and polishing error messages for internationalization

- **60%** of the code was **written and manually refined by a human developer**, especially for:
  - Language architecture design
  - Interpreter execution logic
  - Deep debugging, corrections, and refinements
  - Final decisions on syntax and behavior
  - Custom error handling and edge case management

---

## Why AI was used

- To **accelerate** the creation of basic structures and repetitive parts.
- To **generate drafts** for large boilerplate code faster.
- To **enhance translation** and improve natural language error messages.
- To **maintain consistency** across a large amount of similar patterns (e.g., token matching, visitor patterns).

## What remained strictly human

- The **core language logic**, including parsing, evaluation, memory model, and function handling.
- All **critical design decisions**.
- Handling of **error messages** with human review and corrections.
- Final **polishing and code quality** passes.

## Final Note

Yen Language is a **human-driven project** with **AI-accelerated development**.  
We firmly believe AI can be an incredible tool to **amplify human creativity and productivity**, but it does not replace critical thinking, manual code review, or the unique insight that human developers bring.

Together, human and AI collaboration led to a faster, stronger, and cleaner first version of the Yen Language.
