# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At the moment, **Yen Language** is in its **early development stage** (Beta).  
Only the latest commit on the `main` branch is supported.

In the future, stable versions (`1.0.0` and above) will have proper security support.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability or a security issue, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, report it privately:

- Send an email to: **IN CREATION** (⚡ _placeholder – you can update when you have a real email_)
- Provide as much detail as possible:
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Impact assessment (what an attacker could do)
  - Suggested fixes (if any)

We will acknowledge your report within **72 hours** and aim to provide a patch within **14 days**.

---

## Security Priorities

- Prevent remote code execution vulnerabilities.
- Prevent memory corruption, buffer overflows, or crashes (especially after multi-platform support).
- Prevent privilege escalation through language features.
- Maintain a secure sandbox in future runtime features (planned).

---

## In Progress

- Hardened input validation at parsing and runtime.
- Future sandbox mode for safe script execution.
